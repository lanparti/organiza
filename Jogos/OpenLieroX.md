How do I make my own Internet/LAN server?
	Navigate to Net Play – Host, choose a player to play with and click OK.
My server does not appear in the server list, why?
	Make sure you tick the "Register server" checkbox when starting the server.
My server has a blue icon in the serverlist, or the server is not visible at all, why?
	Most probably your NAT/Firewall is blocking your server. If you are on a shared network, you probably will not be able to host. If you have your personal Internet connection (such as ADSL), you have to set up your router. An information on how to do this is available at www.portforward.com. OpenLieroX uses port 23400 (same as LieroX).
